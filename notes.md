# Notes

- Sometimes we are missing biomes in the generation like desert, snow and lakes. Need to figure out a way to deterministically update the map based on those constraints
- World generation needs to split into continents so we can assign names to them
- More randomness to coast

- Update world generation to allow for different map types?
