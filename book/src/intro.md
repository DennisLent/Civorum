# Civorum

Civorum is a deterministic, ECS-driven, hex-tiled 3D 4X simulator.
This book hosts my dev diary, as well as the documentation.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository and build with Rust stable.
- See the Architecture section for crate-level overviews.
- For local docs: install mdBook and run `mdbook serve book`.
